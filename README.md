1)Input File Handling:
Upload the file (e.g., CSV, Excel). Identify the data type (numerical or categorical) and sub-categories (binary, multiclass, continuous, or discrete). Modeling Process:

2)For numerical data:
Continuous: Try Linear Regression → Polynomial Regression → Ridge Regression → Lasso Regression → ElasticNet → SVM Regression. Discrete: Try Decision Tree Regressor → Random Forest Regressor → Boosting Regressor → KNN Regressor → Naive Bayes Regressor → SVM Regressor. For categorical data:

Binary: Try Logistic Regression → SVM Classifier. Multiclass: Try Decision Tree Classifier → Random Forest Classifier → Boosting Classifier → KNN Classifier → Naive Bayes Classifier → SVM Classifier.

3)Evaluation:
For each model, evaluate its accuracy. If the accuracy is below 80%, move to the next model in the list.

4)Result:

Display the model with the highest accuracy above the threshold (if found).
